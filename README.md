# RT modeling

## Project Description

This repository provides the tools and data necessary to explore the relationship between response time and extremity in social judgments, with a particular focus on cultural differences. For any questions or issues, please contact the lead researcher.

We are using an open dataset from PSA001. Participants (N = 11,481) were drawn from diverse cultural backgrounds across 45 countries. The dataset captures a wide range of social judgments and is analyzed through machine learning models and hierarchical general linear models. The study identifies response time as a significant predictor of rating extremity, with cultural variables also playing a critical role in the analysis.

## Version History

- **Version 1 (August 24, 2024):** Initial release, including manuscripts and analysis on response time and rating extremity across various cultural contexts.

## Software Used

- **Data Analysis:** Python, XGBoost, and R for machine learning and statistical modeling.
- **Data Visualization:** Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for generating plots and figures.
