We can no longer provide the actual face photos, but they may be downloaded from the Karolinska Institute Website at http://www.emotionlab.se/ Click on the 'Resources' page.

We have provided in our data spreadsheet both the labels we used for the photos (second column) and the labels used in the original face set made by the Karolinska Institute (first column). 


**NOTE** If you have downloaded the Karolinska set from our old website prior to 12/20/2009, you should NOT use the data or faces for current or future studies, and instead download the revised version of the data set, which is now uploaded on our current website. The old data set and face set have discordant naming schemes, so the name of the image does NOT necessarily match the data for that image. This error has been fixed in the revised version. 

If you have already used the face set, please change the image names (Todorov labeling) accordingly: 

old-->revised

AM54-->AM56
AM55-->AM57
AM56-->AM58
AM57-->AM59
M58-->AM60
AM59-->AM61
AM60-->AM62
AM61-->AM63
AM62-->AM64
AM63--AM65
AM64-->AM66
AM65-->AM67
AM66-->AM68
AM67-->AM69
AM68-->AM70

Naming Scheme: Female faces begin with "AF"to identify them as female while male faces begin with "AM" to identify them as male. Faces are then numbered 01-70 to distinguish them as unique faces. Male faces 54 and 55 were excluded due to bad lighting, and female faces 34 and 35 were excluded to keep an equal number between genders.

Data: Each of the 66 faces was rated 3 times to increase the interrater agreement, thereby increasing reliability. The Excel spreadsheet provides the standardized average ratings in the form of z-scores for each of the 14 traits: attractive, caring, aggressive, mean, intelligent, confident, emotionally stable, trustworthy, responsible, sociable, weird, unhappy, dominant, threatening.
